# Lab 01 – GitHub Setup & First Push

## What this lab does
In this lab, I set up my GitHub repository for the AI-216 course, created a proper folder structure, and made my first successful commits and pushes using Git and GitHub.

## Key Git commands used
- git init
- git add .
- git commit -m "message"
- git push
- git checkout -b branch-name
- git merge branch-name

## What I learned
- How to initialize and manage a Git repository locally
- How to push code to GitHub and handle branches
- How to resolve basic Git issues and conflicts

## AI/ML relevance
Version control is essential in AI/ML workflows to ensure reproducibility, track experiments, and collaborate efficiently with teams on shared codebases.
## AI Usage Log (Task 9)

### Question 1: What does .gitignore do and why do we need it?
**AI Response:**  
A `.gitignore` file tells Git which files and folders should not be tracked or committed to the repository. It is used to exclude temporary files, environment-specific settings, and generated files such as Python cache, virtual environments, and editor configurations. This keeps the repository clean, reduces unnecessary clutter, and prevents sensitive or system-specific files from being pushed to GitHub.

### Question 2: Review my README for clarity; suggest improvements.
**AI Response:**  
The README is clear and well-structured. To improve clarity, section headings can be kept consistent, explanations can be slightly expanded for beginners, and bullet points can be used where appropriate to improve readability. Overall, the README effectively explains the lab objectives and outcomes.

### Question 3: Suggest 3 formatting improvements for my script output + a module docstring.
**AI Response:**  
1. Add clear labels (e.g., “Name:”, “Student ID:”, “Python Version:”) to make the output easier to read.  
2. Use consistent spacing and line breaks between output sections.  
3. Group related information together for better readability.  

**Suggested module docstring:**  
“This script prints basic student information, displays the Python version, and includes a short reflection on the importance of programming for AI.”
